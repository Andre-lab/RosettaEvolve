"Atomistic simulation of protein evolution reveals sequence covariation and time-dependent fluctuations of site-specific substitution rates", Christoffer Norn and Ingemar Andr√©.

The repo focuses on aspecte related to RosettaEvolve. RosettaEvolve is a set of methods used to simulated the evolution of proteins using an atomistic energy function and a stability-based fitness function. The code for RosettaEvolve is distrubuted through Rosetta (https://www.rosettacommons.org/software) macromoecular modeling package, and the code found here. 


There are four types of Rosetta evolve simulations presented in the study:

1) Sequence equilibration simuations used to equilibrate the sequence for a given energy offset value. Example data and scripts in the directory equilibration_run. 
2) Production runs simulating protein evolutionary along a single branch. The starting sequences and structures taken from the the end of the equilibration runs at given offsets. Example data and scripts in the directory production_run.
3) Mutational trajectories where the trajectory is finished once a  single mutation is inserted. This is repeated as many times as there are sites in the protein. Example data and scripts in the directory single_mutation_trajectory. 
4) Simulation of a phylogenetic tree using RosettaEvolve. A tree crawling alogorithm recursively visits all the branches of a pre-defined phylogenetic tree. Example data and scripts in the directory tree_crawling.

Amino-acid site-rates are evalulated for some trajectories using a script based on a markov state model presented in "Norn C, Andre I, Theobald DL. A thermodynamic model of protein structure evolution explains empirical amino acid substitution matrices. Protein Sci. 2021;30(10):2057-68. Epub 2021/07/05. doi: 10.1002/pro.4155." The script is found in the directory site_rates.

More information can be found in README files in each of the subdirectories.
